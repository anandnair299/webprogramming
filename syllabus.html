	<h2 id="clientConcept">Client Concept</h2>
	Typically, a client is a computer application, such as a web browser, that runs on a user's local computer, smartphone, or other device, and connects to a server as necessary. Operations may be performed client-side because they require access to information or functionality that is available on the client but not on the server, because the user needs to observe the operations or provide input, or because the server lacks the processing power to perform the operations in a timely manner for all of the clients it serves. Additionally, if operations can be performed by the client, without sending data over the network, they may take less time, use less bandwidth, and incur a lesser security risk.<br>
When the server serves data in a commonly used manner, for example according to standard protocols such as HTTP or FTP, users may have their choice of a number of client programs (e.g. most modern web browsers can request and receive data using both HTTP and FTP). In the case of more specialized applications, programmers may write their own server, client, and communications protocol which can only be used with one another.<br>
Programs that run on a user's local computer without ever sending or receiving data over a network are not considered clients, and so the operations of such programs would not be termed client-side operations.<br><br>

	<h2 id="serverSideScripting">Server-side scripting</h2>
	Server-side scripting is a technique used in web development which involves employing scripts on a web server which produces a response customized for each user's (client's) request to the website. The alternative is for the web server itself to deliver a static web page. Scripts can be written in any of a number of server-side scripting languages that are available (see below). Server-side scripting is distinguished from client-side scripting where embedded scripts, such as JavaScript, are run client-side in a web browser, but both techniques are often used together.<br>
Server-side scripting is often used to provide a customized interface for the user. These scripts may assemble client characteristics for use in customizing the response based on those characteristics, the user's requirements, access rights, etc. Server-side scripting also enables the website owner to hide the source code that generates the interface, whereas, with client-side scripting, the user has access to all the code received by the client. A downside to the use of server-side scripting is that the client needs to make further requests over the network to the server in order to show new information to the user via the web browser. These requests can slow down the experience for the user, place more load on the server, and prevent the use of the application when the user is disconnected from the server.<br>
When the server serves data in a commonly used manner, for example, according to the HTTP or FTP protocols, users may have their choice of a number of client programs (most modern web browsers can request and receive data using both of those protocols).

	<h2 id="webComponents">Web Components</h2>
	Web Components are a set of features that provide a standard component model for the Web allowing for encapsulation and interoperability of individual HTML elements.
Primary technologies used to create them include:
<ul>
    <li>Custom Elements: APIs to define new HTML elements</li>
    <li>Shadow DOM: encapsulated DOM and styling, with composition</li>
    <li>HTML Templates: HTML fragments that are not rendered, but stored until instantiated via JavaScript</li>
</ul>
	<h4 id="customElements">Custom Elements</h4>
	There are two parts to Custom Elements: autonomous custom elements and customized built-in elements. Autonomous custom elements are HTML elements that are entirely separated from native HTML elements; they are essentially built from the bottom up using the Custom Elements API. Customized built-in elements are elements that are built upon native HTML elements to reuse their functionality.
	<h4 id="shadowDOM">Shadow DOM</h4>
	Shadow DOM is a functionality that allows the web browser to render DOM elements without putting them into the main document DOM tree. This creates a barrier between what the developer and the browser can reach; the developer cannot access the Shadow DOM in the same way they would with nested elements, while the browser can render and modify that code the same way it would with nested elements. The impact of CSS scoped within the Shadow DOM of a particular element is that HTML elements can be encapsulated without the risk of CSS styles leaking and affecting elements that they were not supposed to affect. Although these elements are encapsulated with regard to HTML and CSS, they can still fire events that can be picked up by other elements in the document.<br>
The scoped subtree in an element is called a shadow tree. The element the shadow tree is attached to is called a shadow host.<br>
Shadow DOM must always be connected to an existing element, either through attaching it as a literal element or through scripting. In JavaScript, Shadow DOMs are attached to an element using Element.attachShadow().
	<h4 id="htmlTemplate">HTML Template</h4>
	HTML template is a way to insert chunks of HTML that are stamped at will. The syntax of HTML templates looks like this:<br>
	Scripts will not run, and resources that are inside a template will not be fetched until the template is stamped out.<br><br>
</p>
</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>

	<h2 id="webContent">Web content</h2>
	Web content is the text, visual or audio content that is made available online and user encountered as part of the online usage and experience on websites. It may include text, images, sounds and audio, online videos, among other items placed within web pages.<br>
In the book Information Architecture for the World Wide Web, Lou Rosenfeld and Peter Morville wrote, "We define content broadly as 'the stuff in your website.' Web content may include webpage document pages, information, software data and applications, e-services, images, audio and video files, personal Web pages, archived e-mail messages stored on email servers, and more. And we include future web content as well as present web content roadmap.<br><br>
